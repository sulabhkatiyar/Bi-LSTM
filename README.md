# Bi-LSTM
## Partial re-implementation of Image Captioning with Deep Bidirectional LSTMs


### Introduction:
This model is similar to Bi-LSTM model proposed in _Image Captioning with Deep Bidirectional LSTMs_ published in _24th ACM international conference on Multimedia_ [[link]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2964284.2964299) . An updated paper was published in journal ACM TOMM [[link]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3115432).
There are following differences in our implementation:
1. I have not used Data Augmentation in this implementation.
